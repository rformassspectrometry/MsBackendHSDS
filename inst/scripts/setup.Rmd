# Data and server setup

Here we first create the test data that we will use later in combination with an
[h5serv](https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5serv) instance.

## Data preparation

We will use the two *sciex* test files from the `msdata` package.

```{r}
library(Spectra)
library(msdata)

fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE)

sps <- Spectra(fls, backend = MsBackendHdf5Peaks(), source = MsBackendMzR())

```

## Server setup

## Tests with the `hdf5client` package
